**🌙 Moonlight OET AI Tutor – Retrieval-Augmented LLM Demo**

This project is a small but powerful demo of how an LLM + retrieval system can work together to support students preparing for the OET (Occupational English Test).

It combines:

TF-IDF similarity search (to find relevant past samples)

OpenAI’s GPT-4.1-mini (to generate clear, helpful explanations)

Friendly tutor-style responses

Error-tolerant design (gracefully handles rate limits / offline mode)

As a result, the system acts like a tiny AI tutor:
it retrieves similar OET examples from your dataset and explains why certain answers are correct, partial, or incorrect — in a simple, encouraging tone.

**⭐ Why This Project Matters**

I’m building Moonlight OET, a set of modern study tools designed to support healthcare professionals preparing for the OET exam.
This AI tutor is the first step toward creating a full, intelligent OET assistant that can:

understand student questions in a natural, helpful way

retrieve the most relevant past examples for guidance

highlight common mistakes and explain why they happen

give clear, practical tips students can immediately apply

This prototype shows how retrieval + LLMs can work together to give personalized feedback.
In the future, I plan to expand it into a full RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with richer datasets, embeddings, and student progress tracking.



**🧠 How It Works (Simple Overview)**
**1️⃣ Load a small dataset**

A concise CSV of labeled OET samples (correct, incorrect, partial) is prepared in
01_data_preparation.ipynb.

**2️⃣ Build a TF-IDF retriever**

Using sklearn, the model finds the closest examples to any new student question.

**3️⃣ Create context for the LLM**

Relevant examples are formatted into a readable context block:

Example 1:
Text: ...
Label: Partial
Task: Reading Part A

**4️⃣ Ask the LLM**

The LLM receives both the question + examples and responds as:

short

clear

encouraging

OET-focused

**5️⃣ Friendly error handling**

If the API hits a rate limit or disconnects, the tutor responds gently instead of crashing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.12
- Jupyter Notebooks
- scikit-learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)
- Pandas
- OpenAI API (GPT-4.1-mini)

**🚀 How to Run the Tutor Yourself**
**1. Create a virtual environment**
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

**2. Install dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

**3. Add your OpenAI API key**

Inside 02_baseline_qa.ipynb, update:

client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_KEY_HERE")

**4. Run the notebook**

Start with → 01_data_preparation.ipynb
Then → 02_baseline_qa.ipynb

You will see:

retrieved examples

similarity scores

a friendly tutor explanation

**💡 Example Output (Conceptual)**

To avoid losing marks for partial answers in OET Listening, try to capture the full detail — not just the main idea.
Partial answers often miss numbers, timings, or instructions.
A quick tip: listen for verbs + details, and double-check the end of the recording for clarifications.

**🌟 What I Learned**

How to build a simple retrieval system

How to structure an LLM workflow with context + labels

How to design friendly AI user experiences

How to handle rate limits and API errors gracefully

How to package small ML/LLM demos into clean portfolio projects

**✨ Next Steps (Future Work)**

Move from TF-IDF to a small embedding model

Add student progress tracking

Build a lightweight web UI (Streamlit/FastAPI)

Expand dataset to full OET Reading/Listening samples

Turn this into part of a RAG-powered study assistant
